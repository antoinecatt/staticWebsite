        <h2>The 3 Buckets To Fill For A Good Life</h2>

        <div class="expanded row">
            <div id="vitality" class="section column large-4">
                <a href="vitality.html"><h1 class="title">VITALITY</h1></a>
                <p class="description">This is where most of the physical self-care fits, though would also include good mental health. The number one factor here, according to Jonathan, is getting good SLEEP. And then, certainly, quality nutrition, exercise, meditation, coping
                    skills for stress, etc.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="connection" class="section column large-4">
                <a href="connection.html"><h1 class="title">CONNECTION</h1></a>
                <p class="description">As Br√©ne Brown famously says, humans are hard-wired for connection, love, and belonging. Some studies (like the classic Harlow monkeys) have even demonstrated that this sense of belonging is even more important in some ways than physiological
                    needs. If you feel a lack of connection with self, family, friends, or community, your Connection bucket is low, which can lead to feeling depressed, detached, and isolated. Jonathan also includes connection to nature and ‚Äúsource‚Äù
                    (or however you refer to a sense of spirituality or ‚ÄúGod‚Äù) as important components of this bucket for many people.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="contribution" class="section column large-4 ">
                <a href="contribution.html"><h1 class="title">CONTRIBUTION</h1></a>
                <p class="description">This bucket is about the many ways in which we contribute to the world ‚Äî through vocation, calling, purpose, creative ventures, volunteer work, and so on. The important thing to recognize with this bucket is that it can look very different
                    from person to person, but without something filling it, feelings of emptiness and disconnection begin to loom and create a general sense of ‚Äúblah‚Äù (in clinical terms). üòâ Depending on what your paying job is, some people feel a strong
                    sense of contribution through their work. Others may choose a job that may not feel as ‚Äúfulfilling‚Äù but get fulfillment in areas outside their work through contribution with family, friends, and organizations.</p>
